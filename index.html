                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Do I need to know how to code?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Who can attend?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>You are eligible to participate in QuHacks 2020 if you currently attend school (middle or high school) in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia, or DC, and reside in one of those states (or DC). If you have already graduated high school but would still like to attend the event, please consider volunteering or mentoring for the event!

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Nothing! This event is entirely free of charge, thanks to our awesome sponsors. If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, please email us at <a href="mailto:freddy@quhacks.tech">freddy@quhacks.tech</a></p>

                        <p>But of course! We will be giving away up to $840 in prizes this year; you could win up to $50 per person on your team! You can get a sneak peek of the prizes at <a href="https://quhacks2020.devpost.com/">https://quhacks2020.devpost.com/</a></p>

                        <p>The only thing you need is a device that can connect to the internet, and any materials needed for creating your hack! QuHacks 2020 will be held entirely online, so you can join in from the comfort (and safety) of your own home.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes indeed! All the same parts of QuHacks you know and love will still be happening, just virtually (except for the food; we don't have that kind of technology yet, but that would be a great hackathon project if you figure it out!). We will also be opening a moderated Discord server where hackers can chat, ask questions, and receive important announcements. Check our <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> for more information on what will be happening when.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Seriously though, don't be that one person.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">What if I don't have a team?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No problem! Many participants sign up without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 4 people per team.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>At some point, Freddy had a cheesy description here. However, we can't seem to decide what Freddy is, so we'll just say he's that one duck you keep seeing around  of this website.</p>
